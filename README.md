Backend project in python showcasing OOPs, SOLID, design patterns.

Each kingdom has an animal emblem and Shan needs to send a message with the animal in the message to win them over. Once he wins 3 more kingdoms, he is the ruler! The secret message needs to contain the letters of the animal in their emblem. For example, secret message to the Land kingdom (emblem: Panda) needs to have the letter 'p','n','d' atleast once and 'a' at-least twice. If he sends "a1d22n333a4444p" to the Land kingdom, he will win them over.
